Welcome to our project GitHub, we have split our work into two separate branches:

SOC - Holds all hardware code. Worked on mostly by Eli Levy-Mackay and Troy Jones.

GUI - Holds all code for user interface, also contains everthing you need to run our simulation with test data. Worked on mostly by Evan Foley, Kormah Dorko, and Rodrigo Mouron.
